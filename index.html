      <h2>Once upon a time,</h2>
      <p>
        there was a little boy and a little girl who entered their first year in high school,
        little did they know how their high school journey would end…This boy used to always see the girl,
        in the hallways and outside of class, he used to admire her and how beautiful she was and always wished for an opportunity to speak to her or even be close to her
        Luckily for him his childhood friend ashley, was close friends with this girl, he used subtly ask ashley about amy and what she likes to do without giving away his huge crush.
        The boy loved hearing any stories about her, she was so smart beautiful and played basketball just like him, but one day ashley said that this girl also loved a show that the boy was obsessed with.
        After he found out he knew he wanted to talk to her

        However the boy had to wait long and he had to be patient, and by being patient he was rewardeddd, by having his first ever class with her. it was second semester english class, and in this class he knew he wanted to seat near her, however when he got to class his friends and her friend all sat together since they all went to elementary together, however he sat as close as he could with them During that english class he tried his best to impress this girl. He thought of many ways of trying to impress her, and one day he found the perfect thing to say to catch her interest, he asked the teacher “Ms Daniel, could we read the book called avatar the last airbender based of the show”. He made sure to say that when the girl was around hoping it would lead to something.
