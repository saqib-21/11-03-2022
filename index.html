      <h2>Once upon a time,</h2>
      <p>
        a boy and a girl started their first year of high school, unaware of the journey that awaited them. The boy would often see the girl in the hallways, outside of class, and every time he did, he admired her beauty and wished for a chance to talk to her. 
        He wanted nothing more than to be close to her, even if just for a moment.
        Luckily for him, his childhood friend, Ashley, happened to be close friends with this girl. Subtly, without revealing his massive crush, he would ask Ashley about her, what she liked, what she did for fun. Every little detail about her fascinated him. 
        She was smart, beautiful, and, to his surprise, she played basketball just like him. But then, one day, Ashley mentioned something that made his heart race, this girl also loved a show that he was completely obsessed with.
        From that moment, he knew he had to talk to her.

        But patience was key. He had to wait.
        Then, one day, it finally happened.
        In his second semester of English class, fate rewarded him. 
        For the first time ever, they were in the same class. He was determined to sit near her, but when he got to class his friends and her friend all sat together since they all went to elementary together. 
        Still, he found a seat as close as possible, just to be near her. During that English class, he tried his best to impress this girl. He thought of many ways of trying to impress her, and one day he found the perfect thing to say to catch her interest, he asked the teacher “Ms Daniel, could we read the book called avatar the last airbender based of the show”. He made sure to say that when the girl was around, He hoped it would spark something between them. 
        What he didn't know was that it actually would.

    <h2>Two Years Later</h2>
    <p>
      The boy this year was taking all science courses as that's what he enjoys doing, and the girl had followed more of the political path of wanting to become a lawyer. They crossed paths in the hallways from time to time, the girl noticing how much more athletic the boy had become, while the boy still saw her as the most beautiful girl in the school. But they still barely talked.
Until something unexpected happened.
One day, out of nowhere, the girl switched into all of his classes.
The first class she had with him was chemistry class and not only was she in his class—she sat right beside him. It was a miracle

      This chemistry class was small, the perfect opportunity for him to impress her. He thought he could help her with the work, maybe show off a little. But he soon realized something, she was a genius. Before he could even offer to help on the assignment, she said she had already finished the assignment, the boy was amazed. But then… he noticed something.
      She was watching the show that he loved, The very same one that he brought up in grade 9. HIS EYES GREW, he was in awe, such a smart beautiful girl sitting beside him watching the show he loves in class, he immediately said acting like he didn’t already know, "Wait… you like that show? That’s my all-time favourite!" and she said “hehe yeah me too” and offered him one of her AirPods, and boom the talking has begun and this became his favourite class ever.

From that day on, they talked every single day. Being in all of the same classes meant they spent nearly every moment together, and soon, their conversations went beyond school. They talked outside of class, after school, and late into the night. Their connection grew stronger with each passing day.  They loved talking to each other, so their playful conversations turned into flirting and flirting turned into dates.
 They knew they were perfect for each other, so the boy asked her <span id="whole"> </span> ago if he could be her boyfriend, and thankfully she said yes and they have been together since.

      Every second I spend with you it makes me realize how fortunate and grateful I am to have you in my life. It’s crazy to think about how far we’ve come, from barely speaking in the hallways to spending every moment together and how this website timer will go on forever hehe. 
      I know that no matter where life takes us, we will always have each other. That’s why I made this website, so we can look back, 
      see how our story started, cherish every moment that brought us here, and keep a piece of each other wherever we go. And, of course, to celebrate three amazing years together. I love you soo muchh. Here's to us. Forever and always.
